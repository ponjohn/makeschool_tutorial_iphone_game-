8. Quick recap
Variables store info for later use
in this pgm, var stored critter's nickname & element

Functions r pieces of code that can be called by other parts of the pgm.
made func setupCritterStats(); func dashButtonPressed(); 
     func elementalButtonPressed(); swipeButtonPressed(numberOfSwipes: Int)
     
If-then-else statementws allow our code to react to things.
Used to check if our elemental move would work against our opponent.
If it would, we used it but if it wouldn't we used Swipe instead.

For-Loops allow code to be repeated.
We added a for-loop to use the Swipe a random # of times in a row.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ working code up to step 8.
func initialize()
{   // The code in this function runs first
    nickname = "Lassie"
    setupCritterStats()  }

func setupCritterStats()
{   myElement = "Leaf"
    myLevel = 5  }

// dashButtonPressed called function from a Library
func dashButtonPressed()
{   performDash()   }


// elementalButtonPressed made function using if-then-else statements
func elementalButtonPressed()
{
    if elementMyOpponentIsWeakAgainst == myElement
    {
        performElemental()
    }
    else
    {
        performDash()
    }
}


// swipeButtonPressed made function using for-loop
func swipeButtonPressed(numberOfSwipes: Int)
{
    for counter in 1...numberOfSwipes
    {
        performSwipe()
    }
}


9. Sing Move - only effective if ur critter level > than opponent
Put the opponent to sleep

func singButtonPressed()
{
    if myLevel > opponentLevel
    {
        for counter in 1...(myLevel - opponentLevel)
        {
            performSing()
        }
    }
    else
    {
        //my code here
        myLevel = (opponentLevel + 5)
    }    
}

Final Recap
summarize what we learned
Variables - a way to store info
Functions - a way to reuse code or call code from other parts of the pgm
Handlers - fn that r called when a specific event occurs
Libraries - libraries store fn that someone else wrote (for u to use)
if-then-else statements - alter the flow of the pgm based on different conditions
for-loop - repeat the same chunk of code multiple times
